# Database-Management-Systems

Project:
Restructure a flattened and/or denormalized dataset so it can be loaded into a SQL or Graph database. Identify and demonstrate a form of analysis that is made easier by restructuring the data.

Dataset:
Yelp Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)

NOTE: Only "Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb" and "Final Presentation" are considered the final deliverables. The other files are likely temporary files or drafts created while working on the project. They are not essential for the final product.

This Github Repo consists of:
1. Initial_Code.ipynb: This file consists of the initial code that should be submitted for Deliverable 2 with basic uploading the data, Data Cleaning, etc
2. Database_Implementation.ipynb: This file consists of the code till database implementation
3. Final_Code.ipynb: This file consists of the code which includes:
   - Uploading the data
   - Converting to CSV File
   - Restructuring the data by normalization
   - Loading the restructured data to SQL Database by creating tables
   - Performing analysis of the restructured data
4. Sentiment_Analysis: This file consists the whole project code from loading the data till sentiment analysis
5. DBMS_Presentation: This contains the ppt of the project(till basic Analysis)
6. Basic_Analysis_Before_Restructuring_the_Data.ipynb: This consists of the analysis performed before restructuring the data. It basically includes SQL queries, data visualizations, etc
7. Final_Presentation: This ppt contains the final presentation along with the sentiment analysis.

Steps to be Followed:
1. Please download the file named 'business.json' from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XjPGoSt_UFcMJ_gZM3syTZj-w622K6NB?usp=sharing
2. Open Jupyter notebook/Google Colab and upload the business.json file from local
3. Run the final_project(SQLite,_Python) file to upload, restructure, load into SQLite and analyze the data
